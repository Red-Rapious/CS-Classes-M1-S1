# CS-Classes-M1-S1
The class notes of my computer science classes for the first semester of second year (M1) at ENS Ulm.

## Content
Available classes are:
- [Introduction to Computer Vision (CV)](computer-vision/computer-vision.pdf)
- [Deep Learning (DL)](deep-learning/deep-learning.pdf)
- [Robotics (RB)](robotics/robotics.pdf)
- [Convex Optimization (CO)](convex-optimization/convex-optimization.pdf)

## Progression
Classes are in active development. Below is a summary of the current availability of chapters. Note that chapter titles for future lectures are subject to modifications.
